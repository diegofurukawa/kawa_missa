# Agent Goals

## 1. Primary Objective
Initialize and maintain a scalable, type-safe web application using the defined technology stack, strictly adhering to the AI Governance System.

## 2. Technology Stack (Immutable)
- **Framework**: Next.js (LTS version)

## 3. Secondary Objectives
- Maintain a clean, modular architecture.
- Ensure zero linting errors.
- Prioritize type safety and performance.
- Documentation must run ahead of code.

## 4. Non-Goals
- Adding state management libraries (Redux, Zustand) unless strictly necessary and approved.
- Using CSS-in-JS libraries (Structured Tailwind is preferred).
- Complex microservices architecture (Monolith preferred initially).

## 5. Success Criteria
- [ ] Project initialized with specified stack.
- [ ] Governance structure (`.plans/`, Rules, Conventions) in place.
- [ ] No "magic code" or undocumented features.
- [ ] All plans in `.plans/` are executed successfully.
