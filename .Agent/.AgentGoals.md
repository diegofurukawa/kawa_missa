# Agent Goals

## 1. Primary Objective
Initialize and maintain a scalable, type-safe web application using the defined technology stack, strictly adhering to the AI Governance System.

## 2. Technology Stack (Immutable)
- **Framework**: Next.js (LTS version)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **ORM**: Prisma v7
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **UI Feedback**: Sonner (Toast/Notifications)

## 3. Secondary Objectives
- Maintain a clean, modular architecture.
- Ensure zero linting errors.
- Prioritize type safety and performance.
- Documentation must run ahead of code.
- Provide excellent user experience with fluid, non-intrusive UI components.

## 4. Non-Goals
- Adding state management libraries (Redux, Zustand) unless strictly necessary and approved.
- Using CSS-in-JS libraries (Structured Tailwind is preferred).
- Complex microservices architecture (Monolith preferred initially).

## 5. Success Criteria
- [x] Project initialized with specified stack.
- [x] Governance structure (`.plans/`, Rules, Conventions) in place.
- [x] No "magic code" or undocumented features.
- [x] All plans in `.plans/` are executed successfully.
- [x] Middleware validates tenant existence and redirects gracefully.
- [x] Public UI components are fluid and non-intrusive.
- [x] Login access via modal instead of fixed header button.
- [x] Select-tenant page has clear navigation with Login and Onboarding buttons.
- [x] Date/time handling preserves local timezone (pt-BR, 24h format).
